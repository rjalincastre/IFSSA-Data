## ‚ùó Problem Statement

The current system faces the following challenges:

- Inaccurate demand prediction during seasonal or religious events
- Difficulty identifying repeat clients who may need support again
- Lack of insight into neighborhood-specific food needs

These issues result in planning and resource allocation inefficiencies.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Estimate Food Demand**: Analyze historical data to forecast hamper requirements based on family size, time of year, and cultural events.
- **Client Retention Insights**: Identify patterns in returning clients for better resource and communication planning.
- **Service Area Targeting**: Map and analyze neighborhoods with increasing or decreasing needs.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Explore tools like large language models for improved client interaction and automated reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solution

Our approach includes:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop ML models to forecast food demand and classify client return likelihood.
- **Geographic Insights**: Use clustering and mapping techniques to visualize service demand by area.
- **AI Tools Integration**: Experiment with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and multimodal models for natural language tasks such as report generation and support communication.
- **Cultural Alignment**: Collaborate closely with IFSSA staff to ensure that all solutions remain sensitive to cultural practices and operational workflows.
